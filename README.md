## xStream Player for MetalliQ
***
xStream is the biggest german streaming Add-On for Kodi. Therefor I always wanted a integration of that plattform in my beloved Extended Info Mod.
So here it is!

*** 

xStream doesn't use indexers like Specto or similar Add-Ons do. If you start [xstream](http://xstream-addon.square7.ch/showthread.php?tid=1) it gives you the possibility to manually scan all different pages. Therefor my intention was, to integrate the global search function in MetalliQ. 
***

The scanned sites are *NOT* following certain rules. This is not a problem for movies, but for shows. I didn't find a possiblity to intergrate a precise, universal and statisfying search function that delivers exact results for episodes.
