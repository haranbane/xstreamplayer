## xStream Player for MetalliQ
***
xStream is the biggest german streaming Add-On for Kodi. Therefor I always wanted a integration of that plattform in my beloved Extended Info Mod.
So now it's here and it works!

*** 

xStream doesn't use indexers like Specto or similar sites. The within scanned pages are *NOT* following certain rules. This is not a problem for movies, but for shows. I didn't find a possiblity to intergrate a precise, universal and statisfying search function which delivers exact episodes.
